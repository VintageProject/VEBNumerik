An additional indicator board to use with the NKM Numerik's breadboard section.
It'll plug in a full row on any of the two breadboards and can be used for outputs up to the 9V of the double battery pack.
The LEDs, if equipped with 330R..390R (for 5V) will see around 20mA then. You might want to use larger resistors just in case.
