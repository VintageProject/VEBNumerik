Nothing fancy. Just a way to use an ATTiny85 with your NKM Numerik kit.
You're more of a PIC person? Take a look at the PIC board, then. :)

This board is a breakout for the ATTiny and it sports a handy ISP header as per the 6-pin standard. If you want to use the 10-pin header, you'll have to use an adapter or change the board design.
