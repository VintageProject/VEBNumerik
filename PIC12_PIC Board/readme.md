Nothing fancy. Just a way to use a PIC12 (e.g. PIC12F675) with your NKM Numerik kit.
You're more of an ATTiny person? Take a look at the ATTiny85 board, then. :)

This board is a breakout for the PIC12 and it sports a handy ICSP header as per the PICKit standard. I left the "N.C." in as I found that the programming cables often come in a six wire configuration and I wanted to accommodate those without modification.
